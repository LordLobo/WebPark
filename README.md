# WebPark

REST that is a walk in the park!

Using generics and Swift Concurrency, WebPark provides a simple set of HTTP interactions with a minimal API.

## Usage

Implement the `WebPark` protocol and add a `baseURL`.

```
import WebPark

struct myREST : WebPark {
    let baseURL = "https://mydataendpoint.com"
}
```

Then create the codable object you're expecting:

```
struct MyData : Codable {
    let name: String
}
```

Then add a method for an endpoint:

```
extention myREST {
    func getMyData() async throws -> MyData {
        return await get("/endpointForMyData")
    }
}
```

If the web service requres tokens, create an implementation of `WebParkTokenServiceProtocol`, and include it in your WebPark struct.

```
struct MyTokenService: WebParkTokenServiceProtocol {
    var token: String
    
    func refreshToken() async throws {
        // refresh token code
    }
}

struct myREST : WebPark {
    let baseURL = "https://google.com"
    let tokenService = MyTokenService()
}
```
